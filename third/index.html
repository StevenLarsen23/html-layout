        I won't give up, so don't give in.
You've fallen down but you will rise again.
I won't give up.<br>
        When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win<br>
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight<br>
